# GitHubIssueByAmeyBairolu

Started working on project at: 4PM

Overview:

1. I tried to use whatever Data I could comprehend from an actual GitHub's issues page. 
2. I, of course, used JavaScript in the project only to get Data easily instead of spending time on copy pasting each data from the API and to Avoid repeatative tasks.
3. The view.js file anyway uses proper HTML syntax to display data dynamically.

Time taken to complete this project: 2 hours 55 minutes.

I could add more to the achieved target, but adding another feature could take another 20 minutes and I also have to wrap up everything before 7PM.
